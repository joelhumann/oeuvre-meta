# Joel Humann – Oeuvre

This repository is a **meta-index** of my musical output and compositional experiments. It is not a monolith, but a constellation — each part of the oeuvre lives in its own space, with its own logic, tempo, and voice. This file links to the various repositories that house my creative work, organized by type and function.

## 🧪 `oeuvre-studies`  
**Status:** Public  
**Contents:** Ironic sketches, compositional fragments, unfinished pieces, and concept studies — they live in a permanent state of becoming. Numbered with a deliberately absurd versioning system (e.g., `Op. 0.01-alpha`). These works never reach v1.0.  
**Repo:** [oeuvre-studies](https://github.com/yourusername/oeuvre-studies)

---

## 📜 `oeuvre-works`  
**Status:** Private  
**Contents:** Formal compositions for publication and public performance.  
**Repo:** Private — available on request.

---

## 🎷 `oeuvre-opus-infinity`  
**Status:** Public  
**Contents:** My jazz compositions — lead sheets, charts, and evolving arrangements. Numbered sequentially, with optional version tags if a tune takes on new shapes. This is the infinite gig book.  
**Repo:** [oeuvre-opus-infinity](https://github.com/yourusername/oeuvre-opus-infinity)

---

## 🧬 `oeuvre-ex-opere-operato`  
**Status:** Public  
**Contents:** Generative, algorithmic, and computer-native compositions. SuperCollider, Python, and beyond. This is music ex machina — works that exist because they are executed.  
**Repo:** [oeuvre-ex-opere-operato](https://github.com/yourusername/oeuvre-ex-opere-operato)

---

## 🎸 `vicious-circle`  
**Status:** Public (some assets private)  
**Contents:** All pop/rock-related work under the banner of **Joel Humann and the Vicious Circle**. Lead sheets, arrangements, lyrics, gig notes. Recordings are kept private or external.  
**Repo:** [vicious-circle](https://github.com/yourusername/vicious-circle)

---

## 🔒 `recordings`  
**Status:** Private  
**Contents:** Demos, studio takes, raw stems, audio drafts. This material is under embargo until ready for release or distribution.  
**Repo:** Private — internal use only.

---

## 🧰 Utilities & Shared Tools  
**Status:** Mixed  
**Examples:**
- `persichetti-python/` — compositional tooling based on Vincent Persichetti's *Twentieth-Century Harmony*
- `supercollider-snippets/` — reusable SC code blocks

## Notes
- GitHub is the working archive, not the finished museum.
- Folder and versioning structures reflect aesthetic decisions as much as practical ones.
- If you're looking for something, ask. If you want to collaborate, write.
